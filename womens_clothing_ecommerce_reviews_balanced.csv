-1,Uhm no. oh dear  no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric  the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy  oh boy was i right. sadly  this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top  though.,Blouses
-1,Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style  but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s  my typical size.,Blouses
-1,I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...,Blouses
-1,"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok  but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops  but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said ""that's a piece of tablecloth."" it's going back.",Blouses
-1,This top seemed so unique online  but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full  shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..,Blouses
-1,"Sadly  this has to go back. i am 5'5""  128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful  the detail is nice in person  even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles  loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.",Blouses
-1,This top was supposed to be 23 1/4 inches long in petite. it's actually 28 1/2 inches long.  it's also large in width. hard to believe it's an extra small petite.,Blouses
-1,This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!,Blouses
-1,Beautiful print  however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer  much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami  however my nude bra was completely visible.  the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans  so much shorter than the tunic length shown  and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim  and the bottom half are looser).  over,Blouses

0,After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there's no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo,Blouses
0,"I am 5 8""  130 and i usually wear a 4 in tops like this from retailer but the fit of this one was not good for me. though the styling and details of the top are lovely  it was small through the shoulders and very large everywhere else. looked too much like maternity. i love the shape of this kind of top but to be flattering it actually needs to be fitted through the bust and upper body and then flare in the right places and this was pretty boxy all around. too bad - so cute!",Blouses
0,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look""  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2""  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2"")  this a a",Blouses
0,I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful aesthetically  and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out  so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.  however  i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me  which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt  which looked nice. however  the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s,Blouses
0,I love this fabric  and the design details of this top. but i am only 5'3  and this top ends above my waist! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering. i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much  but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is. tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out  for someone without a perfectly flat tummy.,Blouses
0,I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite  i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece  as many reviewers have n,Blouses

1,Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas  so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect  since the colors aren't look too summery  but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy  but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops  this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.,Blouses
1,I ordered this top in the white and cream color combo and love it so much. the buttons in the back add a sweet touch - easy top for fall  spring (easy to throw a cardigan over)  and summer. i ordered a medium  but probably could have done a small. classic retailer!,Blouses
1,This top is really pretty. the fabric is soft and flowy (not too boxy) and the elastic at the top is comfortable. it does not ride up or fall off the shoulders  which i've found with tops of similar design. in my regular size s (5'6 - 125lb)  i didn't find the sleeves tight like others have mentioned. one thing i did notice was that the hidden straps that many other tops and dresses have (the ones for hanging on a hanger) are sewn right on the edge of the upper elastic making them pop up a bit.,Blouses
-1,I wanted this dress so much  i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up  at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on  and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced  but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad  as it seems like it would be a nice,Dresses
-1,Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.,Dresses
-1,I was so excited to buy it online  but it come in a small plastic bag  and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got  so i had to return it,Dresses
-1,I don't know how to explain  but this dress at least for me did not look like the model  first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts  for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body  i am normal height (5'5''  athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting  it's so soft!,Dresses
-1,The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering  the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail,Dresses

-1,Thought this would be a great dress for warm days  but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8  usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape  this is a great dress with nice detailing  but sadly the shape did not work for me.,Dresses
-1,I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews,Dresses
0,It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.,Dresses
0,So many things to love: love the mod kind of style  the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model  i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it  but the waist is already so high  i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.,Dresses
0,This dress is a bit scratchy  but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair  the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene.     the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders  small chest and and slim.,Dresses
0,Really liked this dress  but it ran too big for me.,Dresses
0,I got this dress in the mail  and while i loved the concept of it  it really is too boxy. the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist  it is more so for show. it is fully lined which was interesting  and to me  made the dress seem boxier. the quality is good  but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering. i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot  but it would have still been a shapeless dress  just bigger. it does fit true to size ,Dresses
0,This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also  this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!,Dresses
0,"I am 5'4""  100lbs  petite frame  i bought this dress in xxsp. the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined  good for fall  maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days  but perhaps a cooler summer day. unfortunately this dress runs pretty large  much too large for my petite frame  so i had to return it. i would recommend sizing down. this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks  also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event.",Dresses

-1,The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.,Fine gauge

0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates

0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
1,This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup  and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now  at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band  and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure  but it fits perfectly there for me.,Intimates

-1,I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).,Jackets

-1,Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,Jackets

-1,This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.,Jackets

0,This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.,Jackets

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

1,I sat on the fence almost too long on this piece and finally ordered one when it popped up as a return...so happy imwas able to snag it. it is incredible. i put it with my favorite closed jeans and chanel work boots and wow! i also have tried belting it where the fur begins and that looks equally fabulous. imput true to size as it is suppose to be roomy  to many people ruin styles by trying to get them to fit in a way they were not meant to...embrace the uniqueness of this piece and roder true t,Outerwear
1,Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-),Outerwear

1,This coat is beautiful! i love the color and the design. it definitely runs a little large. i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem. i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already. the vest keeps it warm  but the sleeves aren't lined so it's cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if you're going to be in cold weather.,Outerwear

-1,I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills  stain remover  or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.,Pants
-1,"These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5""). i can go between a 4 and a 6  and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said  the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff  and the sheen made them feel cheap  unfortunately.",Pants
-1,I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.,Pants

0,I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get  because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.,Pants

-1,What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.,Skirts
-1,The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip  it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.,Skirts

-1,The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.,Skirts

-1,Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.,Skirts

0,I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4'  125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long  below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed  that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning,Skirts
0,I don't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me  and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs  so i can't size down. the knit is substantial  so that's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just wasn't flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke's tideline pencil skirt  which also has a fabric tie wrap,Skirts

1,I love mixed media clothing  and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away  and after being torn between the two colors  opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however  as soon as i put it on  i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd)  but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest.,Sweaters

-1,I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.,Swim
-1,The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.,Swim
-1,This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable,Swim
-1,Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.,Swim
-1,Loved the material and the style. unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!,Swim
-1,The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.,Swim
-1,Such a cute pattern  and i loved the fold-over design  but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms  and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband  but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent,Swim

0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend
